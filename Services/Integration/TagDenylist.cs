///   - Generic: noise tags that add no genre/mood value ("seen live", etc.)
///   - Offensive: crowdsourced troll/hate tags that occasionally get voted onto
///     legitimate tracks. Add specific terms you've observed here - kept as a
///     plain list so it's easy to extend without touching filtering logic.
