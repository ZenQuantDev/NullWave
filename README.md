## Features

### 🧠 Smart Sorting (AI + Weather)

- **Auto-Mood Playlists**: Generates playlists based on your local weather (via OpenWeather API) and time of day.
- **Local AI Ranking**: Uses a local Ollama instance to rank tracks by suitability for the current mood.
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically scans your CPU, RAM, and GPU VRAM to recommend and download the best AI model for your machine.
- **Last.fm Enrichment**: Automatically backfills missing genre tags and album art for your entire library on startup.

### 📚 Organizer

- Add tracks by URL (YouTube, Last.fm, SoundCloud) or local file
- Auto-fetch metadata from YouTube Data API v3 and Last.fm
- Read ID3 tags from local audio files (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, M4A, AAC)
- Library with search, sort, favorites, play tracking, and queue
- **Multi-select bulk actions (Ctrl/Shift) with floating action bar**
- Bulk folder import with subfolder support and duplicate detection
- Track detail panel with editable title, artist, notes, and tags
- Playlist management and source filters (YouTube, Last.fm, SoundCloud, Local)

### 🎧 Player

- Local file playback via LibVLCSharp
- YouTube audio download via yt-dlp (to `~/.nullwave/downloads/`)
- YouTube and SoundCloud playlist import
- Audiobook mode: playback speed, resume-from-position, chapter navigation, sleep timer

- Dual-player crossfade (experimental, opt-in)
- **Sleep timer (15/30/45/60 min) with live mini-player countdown**
- Light / Dark / System theme modes
- Spotify-style now-playing bar with "Now Playing" accent indicators
- Shuffle, Repeat One, Repeat All, and Seek ±5 seconds
- Autoplay next track on finish

### 🎨 UI & Customization

- **Spotify-style Sidebar**: Collapsible rail mode (Ctrl+B), pinned playlists, playlist folders, and drag-and-drop reordering.
- **Live Theme Engine**: Light/Dark/System modes, 9 accent colors, 10 duotone pairs, 3 density styles, compact mode, and font scaling (zero restarts).
- **Profile Window**: Signed & computed badges, custom banner images, consolidated stats, and Install ID.
- **Localization**: Full English/Russian string tables with live language switching.
- **Onboarding Wizard**: First-run flow for theme, API keys, and download directory.
- **Smart Search**: Operators (`artist:`, `title:`, `tag:`, `is:favorite`, `-exclude`) for precise library filtering.
- **Mood Mix**: Weather-driven playlists (AI or tag-based) with auto-regeneration and pin preservation.

### 🛠️ Maintenance Suite

- Orphaned file sweep (dry-run preview + real deletion)
- Duplicate detection with smart keeper selection

## API Keys

Keys are stored encrypted at `~/.nullwave/keys.enc` - never in the project folder or git history. Manage them via **Settings → API Keys** inside the app, or set environment variables as fallback:

```bash
export NULLWAVE_YOUTUBE_KEY="your_key"
export NULLWAVE_LASTFM_KEY="your_key"
export NULLWAVE_OPENWEATHER_KEY="your_key"
```

---

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK
- libVLC - `sudo dnf install vlc-libs` (Fedora) or `sudo apt install libvlc-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- yt-dlp - `pip install yt-dlp`
- node.js - `sudo dnf install nodejs`

**Windows note:** Requires .NET 8 SDK (or .NET 10 with `<RollForward>Major</RollForward>` in csproj). LibVLC native libraries auto-installed via NuGet. yt-dlp installed via winget.

**Fedora note:** libVLC installs to `/usr/lib64`. NullWave expects `/usr/lib`. Create symlinks:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libvlc.so /usr/lib/libvlc.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libvlccore.so /usr/lib/libvlccore.so
```
