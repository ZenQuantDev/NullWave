All notable changes to NullWave will be documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [0.6.2] - 25-Sep-2026 🧩 "Correctness"

### Added

- **In-App Log Viewer**: Help tab now features a live, filterable log tail (text filter + level chips) with a "Copy Diagnostics" button for easy bug reporting.
- **"What's New" Screen**: Automatically displays a styled release notes popup on the first launch after an update.
- **Unified Process Runner (P9)**: Introduced `ProcessRunner` helper to safely execute external processes with concurrent stdout/stderr reading, preventing OS pipe deadlocks.
- **DevTools Support Bundle**: Fixed a build failure in `SettingsViewModel.DevTools.cs` caused by a missing `using Avalonia.Platform.Storage;` directive, restoring the native file picker (`FilePickerSaveOptions`) for exporting diagnostic zip bundles.

### Changed

- **Mood AI Prompt (C5)**: Added explicit JSON schema to Ollama prompts, capped `num_ctx` to prevent context overflow, and implemented a tolerant index parser.
- **Local AI Resilience (C10)**: Improved Ollama connection-refused detection and removed local file paths from AI prompts for privacy.

### Fixed

- **Plugins Tab Crash (P0)**: Fixed a fatal `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in Avalonia's layout engine caused by a UI binding coercion storm when rapidly toggling plugins.
- **Toast Service**: Fixed `EnforceCap` logic to immediately remove evicted toasts, preventing unbounded collection growth and test failures in headless environments.
- **Spotify Bridge (C7/C11)**: Routed Spotify metadata through the new `SpotifyPageParser` (ignoring Album/Playlist links) and fixed `SplitArtistCredits` to prevent breaking band names like "Florence and the Machine".

---

## [0.6.1] - 23-Sep-2026 🛡️ "Stability & Safety"

### Added

- **Test Infrastructure**: Established xUnit foundation with `NULLWAVE_HOME` isolation, `FakeYtDlp` console harness, and 196 passing tests covering core services, parsers, and data safety.
- **Spotify OpenGraph Parser**: Added `SpotifyPageParser` to extract metadata from public Spotify pages without relying on yt-dlp or premium APIs.
- **Master Key Pinning**: Generated real P-256 cryptographic master key pair for official badge signing.

### Changed

- **Download Output Template**: Changed yt-dlp output to `%(title).150B [%(id)s].%(ext)s` to prevent filename collisions.
- **Database Backups**: Throttled rolling backups to once per 24 hours and only when the database has actually changed.
- **Secure Delete**: Replaced memory-heavy 3-pass overwrite with standard fast deletion; `DeleteEverything` now correctly recurses into subfolders.

### Fixed

- **Data Loss Prevention (P0)**:
    - `KeyStoreService`: Unreadable/corrupt keystores are now quarantined as `.bad-<timestamp>` instead of being silently overwritten. Atomic writes prevent mid-save corruption.
    - `PreferencesService`: Fixed `Dispose()` order so settings changed right before exit are actually saved. Corrupt `prefs.json` files are quarantined.
    - `DatabaseService`: Pending restores now run `PRAGMA integrity_check` before applying. Invalid restores are rejected, and the previous database is kept as `.pre-restore`.
- **Security & Identity (P0)**:
    - `SignedBadge`: Verification now strictly pins against the official NullWave master public key and checks the recipient fingerprint, preventing forged badges.
    - `ProfileShareService`: Capped decompression limits to prevent decompression bombs; fixed BOM round-trip bugs.
- **Download Stability (P1)**:
    - Fixed stuck URLs in `_activeDownloads` when a download is cancelled while queued.
    - Fixed `SemaphoreSlim` drift when concurrency limits are changed mid-flight.
    - Fixed infinite hangs in playlist downloads when duplicate URLs trigger the guard.
    - Added a 20-minute hard timeout ceiling to kill hung yt-dlp/ffmpeg process trees.
- **Playback & Navigation**:
    - Fixed "Previous" button oscillation (bouncing between two tracks) via history stack cleanup and a suppress-history flag during backward navigation.
    - Fixed crossfade play counts and Last.fm scrobbles not registering for the outgoing track.
    - Skip penalties now use time-based decay (`0.5^days`), allowing excluded tracks to naturally recover even if they are never played.
- **Metadata & Integration**:
    - Replaced broken yt-dlp Spotify bridge with robust OpenGraph tag scraper.
    - Fixed `TrackTitleParser` exotic separator handling and NFKC normalization.
    - Fixed `SourceDetector` host-based detection and `TrackRecord` pipe-tag splitting.
    - Fixed `PathHelper` prefix matching bug (e.g., `NullWave-old` no longer mistaken for the data folder).

---

## [0.6.0] - 19-Sep-2026 🌼 "Oxeye Daisy"

### Added

- **Light theme** with Dark / Light / System modes; theme-aware accent mixing in `ThemeService`.
- **Oxeye Daisy** signature accent (#EAB308 / #65A30D); Blue Orchid retained as a regular duo.
- **Audiobook mode**: 0.75x–2.0x speed, resume-from-position, chapter prev/next, "stop at end of chapter" sleep timer.
- **Radio page**: dedicated library page, SomaFM catalog + mood picker, and ICY now-playing metadata.
- **Onboarding Wizard Overhaul**: Expanded to a comprehensive 5-step flow (Appearance, System Dependencies, Services & API Keys, Vault/Downloads, Playback). Includes Ollama/AI model installation guides and unified styling.
- **Settings Tabs Redesign**: Unified style system across Appearance, Audio, API Keys, and Help tabs.
- **API Keys Security & UX**: Secure hidden inputs (`PasswordChar`), inline verification checkmarks, and Last.fm account connection flow.
- **Help Tab**: Quick start guides, API setup links, smart search syntax reference, keyboard shortcuts, and troubleshooting tools (open data/logs folders, restore DB).
- **Audio & Download Settings**: Dedicated Audio tab for format/quality/concurrent downloads, crossfade, and fade-on-pause configurations.
- **Local AI Tag Generation**: Fallback routing to local Ollama models (e.g., `gemma3:4b`) for genre/tag enrichment when Last.fm scrapers return zero tags.
- **Library Maintenance Tools**: Automated orphaned file sweeping, duplicate removal, and title force-cleaning (stripping "Artist - " prefixes and junk from raw YouTube download titles).
- **Localization**: full English/Russian string tables with live language switching.
- **Database safety**: rolling auto-backups with retention and restore-from-backup.
- **Proxy support**: yt-dlp proxy and geo-proxy fields.
- **Download Manager UI**: dedicated view for tracking active, completed, and failed yt-dlp jobs with retry actions.
- **Identity & Install ID**: cryptographic fingerprint generation for profile badges and track sharing prep.
- **Sleep timer** (15/30/45/60 min) with live mini-player countdown.
- **Crossfade (experimental, opt-in)**: dual long-lived `MediaPlayer` engine with generation-guarded transitions.
- **Profile window**: signed + computed badges, consolidated stats, managed avatar/banner assets under `.nullwave/profile-assets/`.
- Version-tap easter egg updated (7 taps: lore toast; 14 taps: signature accent).
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: `Ctrl+L` now instantly focuses and selects the global search bar from anywhere in the app.
- **Rich Sidebar Tooltips**: Collapsed sidebar rail mode now shows rich, theme-aware preview flyouts (displaying playlist names, track counts, and folder contents) on hover.

### Changed

- **Unified UI System**: Checkboxes, sliders, and buttons across Onboarding and Settings now strictly use the centralized `Themes/ControlStyles.axaml` tokens.
- **Language Selector**: Moved to the Appearance step in the Onboarding wizard for better flow; removed "vibe" terminology.
- **Download Manager**: Improved rate-limit throttling and native yt-dlp fallback when `aria2c` is missing.
- **Architecture (Settings Refactor)**: Split the monolithic `SettingsViewModel` into 7 domain-specific `partial` class files (ApiKeys, Preferences, Maintenance, Updates, AI, ExternalAI, Core) to improve maintainability and enforce file-size limits.
- Playback engine: two long-lived players replace per-crossfade player creation; volume-target restore; playback-state watchdog.
- Shuffle / next / previous respect media-type context (music never pulls radio or audiobooks).
- Previous button follows the 3-second rule (restart current track after 3s).
- Sidebar: flattened tile/row shadows; avatars bind decoded bitmaps directly.

### Fixed

- **Onboarding Navigation**: Fixed missing 5th tab and layout spacing issues on "Next"/"Back" buttons.
- **API Key Visibility**: Raw text API keys are now properly masked in the Settings and Onboarding views.
- **XAML Resource Crash**: Fixed `KeyNotFoundException` for `BoolNegation` converter in `DownloadManagerView` that caused fatal crashes on popup open.
- **AI Model Unload**: Improved Ollama model swapping and VRAM eviction policies to prevent timeout hangs on exit.
- **Playlist Downloads**: Gracefully skip unavailable videos and dummy tracks during bulk YouTube playlist imports.
- **System Theme Accent Mixing**: Fixed a bug in `ThemeService` where selecting "System" theme mode caused muddy/unreadable accent colors by correctly resolving the OS-level `ActualThemeVariant` instead of `RequestedThemeVariant`.
- **Mood Generation Double-Toast**: Fixed duplicate toast notifications firing during concurrent or rapid Mood Mix generation by implementing scoped toast grouping (`scope: "mood-gen"`).
- Crossfade native crash (disposed-player race) and silent-after-crossfade playback.
- Queue/shuffle track oscillation; pause/resume state desync.
- Light-theme contrast pass (stars, shuffle/repeat icons, player buttons, grooves).

### Removed

- `Strings.resx` - legacy, unreferenced resource file removed in favor of the custom `LocalizationService` dictionary approach.

## [0.5.2] - 17-Aug-2026

### Added

- **Universal Action Feedback**: Toast notifications now support action buttons (e.g., "Undo" for deletions, "Retry" for failed downloads).
- **Single-Host Toast Routing**: Prevents duplicate toasts when the Settings window is open.
- **Toast Stacking Cap**: Limits visible toasts to 4, dropping the oldest non-live toast to prevent screen clutter.
- **Undo Pattern**: Extended to Playlist and Folder deletions, as well as Queue clearing.
- **Skip Penalty Decay**: Added exponential decay to skip penalties so accidentally skipped songs aren't permanently banned from Smart Shuffle.
- **AI Playlist Padding**: If the AI returns fewer tracks than requested for a mood playlist, it now pads the result with manual tag-matched tracks to ensure a full playlist.

### Fixed

- **Playlist URL Interception**: Playlist URLs are now intercepted _before_ creating a dummy track, preventing 400 Bad Request errors and UI flicker.
- **LocalAIService JSON Parsing**: Fixed `KeyNotFoundException` crashes when Ollama returns malformed JSON or markdown code blocks by adding `TryGetProperty` guards and markdown stripping.
- **YouTube Metadata 400s**: Replaced `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()` with a manual HTTP status check to gracefully handle 400/403/404 API rejections without throwing noisy exceptions.
- **VerifyLinks False Positives**: Drastically reduced (27 > 6) by adding `FeatureArtistRegex` and `BracketContentRegex` to `TitlesLooselyMatch`, and properly handling "Artist - Title" splits.
- **Stale Scrobble Metadata**: Fixed an issue where Last.fm scrobbles used stale cached track data instead of fetching the latest metadata from the database.

## [0.5.0] - 09-Aug-2026 � "Blue Orchid"

### Added

- **Active Playlist Context**: Playback now continues through the active playlist even if the queue is cleared.
- **Slim Scrollbars**: Quiet, minimal scrollbars that reveal on hover.
- **About tab redesign** - gradient hero, version chip (tap 7x for a surprise), "What's new", clickable tech credits, GitHub/issue/license links.
- **Staged self-updater** - in-app download + restart-to-install on both OSes.
- **Live Theme Engine ("Blue Orchid")** - new singleton `ThemeService` applies accent,
  font scale, row density and sidebar width at runtime with zero restarts.
  `Themes/Colors.axaml` brushes now reference colors via `DynamicResource`, so the
  whole app re-skins instantly.
- **Signature edition + Accent Duos** - Appearance tab redesigned: "Blue Orchid"
  signature card (azure + orchid), 9 named base colors, and 10 named complementary
  **Accent Duo** pairs rendered as 50/50 split swatches. Segmented chips replace
  dropdowns for font scale and sidebar width.
- **Density system** - new tokens `TrackRowHeight`, `RowArtSize`, `RowTitleSize`,
  `RowSubSize`, `MiniArtSize`, `RowMargin`, `NavPadding`; Comfortable / Compact /
  Cozy row-style cards plus a global **Compact mode** that shrinks rows, art, nav
  padding and the mini-player bar together.
- **Gradient rollout** - `BrushAccentGradient` (dynamic stops) now drives the seek
  and volume sliders, progress bars and the now-playing accent bar.
- **Artist panel upgrade** - Track Detail shows the Last.fm artist photo with
  placeholder-hash detection (`2a96cbd8�`) and album-art fallback, plus a
  "Fans Also Like" similar-artists row.
- **Windows Support** - Conditional `VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows` package and
  `&lt;RollForward&gt;Major&lt;/RollForward&gt;` for .NET 10 compatibility; `NullWavePaths`
  stores data under `%APPDATA%\NullWave`; `DependencyUpdateService` installs/updates
  yt-dlp and VLC via `winget`; `HardwareDetector` falls back to PowerShell/CIM on
  Windows; native libVLC discovery for Windows install locations.
- **Config hygiene** - `cspell.json` and `.markdownlint.json` updated for the new
  vocabulary (duotone, swatch, orchid, extralarge, �).
- **AI Playlist Persistence**: `ai:` search prompts now create real, persisted playlists in a dedicated "AI Playlists" folder.
- **Playlist Folders**: Added `PlaylistFolderRecord` and `CreateFolderDialog` for organizing playlists.
- **Offline Indicator**: Track list now shows an offline-ready checkmark for locally available tracks.
- **Plugin Feedback**: Toggling plugins in Settings now triggers immediate success/warning toasts.
- **Fullscreen mode**: `F11` / `Alt+Enter` toggles true fullscreen; previous window state (Normal/Maximized) is restored on exit.

### Fixed

- **Instant Sidebar Refresh**: Deleted playlists and folders now disappear from the sidebar immediately (no reboot required).
- **Live Play Counts**: `PlayCount` and `LastPlayed` now update live in the UI via `LibraryChanged` events.
- **Ghost Pin Purging**: Pinned playlists that are deleted are now automatically removed from preferences during sidebar rebuilds.
- **Unified Context Menus**: The 3-dot menu and right-click context menus now have feature parity (both include "Add to Playlist").
- **Dynamic version** display from `.csproj` (About tab, startup log, updater).
- **Track Detail/Queue right panel locked** to 320px, mutually exclusive, non-resizable.
- **Mini-player marquee** - long track titles now scroll: the title is measured at
  full width inside a clipped horizontal `StackPanel`, so overflow detection works.
- **Seek bar duration label** - `PlayerViewModel.Position` now also notifies
  `DurationDisplay`, fixing the right-hand label frozen at `00:00`.
- **Queue Oscillation**: Fixed critical bug where tracks would bounce back and forth due to history stack corruption in `PlaybackNavigator`.
- **Crossfade Stability**:
    - Fixed queue desync causing track oscillation during crossfade.
    - Added safety delay in `PlaybackService` to prevent native PipeWire segfaults on Linux during crossfade teardown.
- **Smart Shuffle Loop**: Added candidate pool floor to prevent 2-track loops under heavy skip pressure.
- **Add to Queue**: Fixed bug where command ignored the passed track parameter and used `SelectedTrack` instead.
- **Right-panel layout collapse** - `MainViewModel.ActiveRightPanelWidth` now returns
  a `GridLength` (320 open / 0 closed). The previous broken binding silently fell
  back to `1*`, leaving a huge black void and an oversized Track Detail/Queue panel.
  Panels stay mutually exclusive and non-resizable by design.
- **VerifyLinks precision** - matcher normalizes artist prefixes
  ("Eminem - X" vs "X"); decoration-aware false-positive tuning tracked in ROADMAP 9.1d.

### Changed

- **Queue System**: Refactored to use `QueueEntry` model, distinguishing between manually added and auto-filled tracks.
- **Roadmap**: Retroactively added Phase 12 (Navigation Redesign) and Phase 14 (Stability & Polish) to reflect shipped work.
- Appearance tab is now a **live** control surface (previously save-only).
- `Preferences.AccentColor` default is now `Blue Orchid`.
- Docs: README bumped to v0.5.0 "Blue Orchid"; ROADMAP gained Phase 15.

## [0.4.2] - 19-Jul-2026

### Added

- **Smart Search Syntax**
    - `LibraryViewModel.ApplySmartSearch` - key:value query syntax: `artist:`/`a:`,
      `title:`/`t:`, `source:`/`s:`, `tag:`/`genre:`, `is:favorite`/`fav`, combined
      with bare global terms (OR-matched against Title/Artist).
    - Multi-word value support via a `pendingKey`/`pendingValueParts` accumulator,
      so `artist:tame impala` parses as a single filter instead of splitting on
      whitespace.
    - Negation support: `-word` (bare exclusion) and `-key:value` (negated filter,
      e.g. `-artist:eminem`).
- **Toolbar Redesign** (`Views/Controls/TrackListView.axaml`)
    - Search box: magnifying-glass icon, inline "?" clear button, and a "?" help
      flyout documenting the smart search syntax.
    - Sort-direction toggle button next to the sort dropdown.
    - Sort dropdown now shows human-readable labels ("Date Added" instead of
      "DateAdded") via new `SortFieldDisplayConverter`.
    - Column headers (Title/Artist, Source, Plays, Added) are now clickable sort
      triggers with a direction-arrow indicator; clicking the active column
      flips sort direction.
    - Track-count label ("415 tracks") added to the header row.
    - "+ Add Track" redesigned as a self-contained flyout (URL input + Add button
        - local file/folder options), replacing the old always-visible "URL INPUT"
          row. Add button gated on new `TrackInputViewModel.IsInputUrlValid`.
- `Helpers/Converters/SortFieldDisplayConverter.cs` and `BoolToSortIconConverter.cs`

### Changed

- `LibraryService`/`LibraryViewModel` sorting now applies a secondary `.ThenBy`
  tie-breaker per `SortField` (mostly by Title), so equal-value groups (e.g.
  many tracks with `PlayCount == 0`) render in a stable, predictable order.
- `TrackInputViewModel.InputUrl` setter now also notifies `IsInputUrlValid`.

### Fixed

- `LibraryViewModel.FetchLibraryDataInternal` - search was silently ignored
  whenever a sidebar source filter (e.g. "YouTube") was active, because the
  `LibraryView.Source` branch never applied the query at all. Also fixed a
  secondary bug where `FilterBySource` results were returned completely
  unsorted regardless of the chosen `SortField`.
- `Views/MainWindow.axaml.cs` - `OnKeyDown`'s typing guard (`e.Source is
TextBox`) only matched the exact source type, but Avalonia's `TextBox` is
  templated - the real typing source is an internal `TextPresenter` - so the
  check silently failed and `M`/`N`/`Space` fired as global hotkeys (mute,
  next track, play/pause) while typing in the search box. Fixed by walking
  the visual tree from `e.Source` to check for any ancestor `TextBox`.
- `Views/Controls/TrackListView.axaml` - toolbar `Grid.ColumnDefinitions`
  didn't declare enough columns for the controls actually placed in it
  (Avalonia silently tolerates out-of-range `Grid.Column` values rather than
  erroring), leaving the layout fragile against future changes.

### Removed

- `ViewModels/Playlists/PlaylistImportViewModel.cs` - constructed and wired
  into `TrackInputViewModel`, but its one real method (`ImportPlaylist`) had
  no call sites anywhere in the app; the actual playlist-download flow has
  run through `MainViewModel`'s `DownloadPlaylistAsync` wiring since v0.4.0.
- `Views/Controls/ImportProgressView.axaml` (+ code-behind) - dead markup
  left over from before the toast-based live activity system replaced inline
  progress bars; also removed its stale reference from `MainWindow.axaml`.

## [0.4.1] - 30-Jun-2026

### Added

- **Robust Playlist Import Engine**
    - `DownloadService.DownloadPlaylistAsync` now features advanced metadata parsing, extracting `artist`, `creator`, `uploader`, and `channel` from `yt-dlp` `--flat-playlist` JSON with strict priority fallback.
    - Automatic stripping of YouTube's " - Topic" suffix from official channel names during playlist parsing.
    - Fallback to `TrackTitleParser` to split messy "Artist - Title" video names into clean, separate metadata fields.
    - Real-time enrichment via `onTrackReady` callback: tracks are linked to their local `FilePath` and passed to `LastFmEnrichmentService` immediately upon individual download completion.
    - Rate limit protection: randomized 3-8 second throttling between playlist track downloads to prevent YouTube 403 rate-limit errors.
- **Database & Library Synchronization**
    - `DatabaseService` now manages `PlaylistRecord` and `PlaylistTrackRecord` tables for full playlist persistence.
    - `PlaylistService` handles full CRUD operations, including track addition, removal, and reordering.
    - `LibraryService` now fires `LibraryChanged` events on `Add`, `Remove`, and `Update`, ensuring the UI reflects database changes instantly.
    - Startup backfillers for missing YouTube and SoundCloud thumbnails.
    - Maintenance utilities: `RepairPaths`, `ReimportAssets`, `ClearTagsForReSync`, and `ClearAllArt`.
- **UI/UX & Theming (`ControlStyles.axaml`)**
    - Comprehensive Avalonia styling system using centralized static resources.
    - New button variants: `.danger`, `.nav`, `.icon-btn`, `.player-btn` (Spotify-style borderless), `.primary`, `.secondary`, and `.ghost` with smooth hover/press transitions.
    - Custom `ToggleSwitch` template with smooth thickness and brush transitions.
    - Layout components: `.settings-card`, `.help-btn`, `.section-label`, and `.BottomSpacer`.
    - Polished `ListBox`, `TextBox`, `ProgressBar`, `Slider`, `ComboBox`, and `TabControl` styles.

### Changed

- `DownloadService` now blocks playlist URLs in the single-track `DownloadAsync` pipeline to prevent duplicate/rogue download processes.
- `DownloadCompleted` and `DownloadFailed` events now include an `isInteractive` boolean flag to distinguish between user-initiated single downloads and background playlist imports.
- `PlayerViewModel` safely ignores non-interactive download events, preventing background playlist imports from hijacking the active player UI, triggering false error toasts, or interrupting currently playing music.
- Accurate error logging: fixed misleading error logs by correctly mapping the first event argument to `trackId` instead of `url` in failure handlers.

### Fixed

- Concurrency race condition where the single-track pipeline hijacked playlist URLs, causing duplicate downloads and rate-limit throttling.
- Background playlist downloads interrupting active playback and flooding the UI with error toasts for unavailable videos.
- Playlist tracks appearing in the library with "Unknown Artist" and missing album art due to incomplete flat-playlist JSON metadata.
- Tracks not being playable immediately after playlist download due to `FilePath` not being written back to the database.

- **Last.fm Enrichment & Album Art**
    - `Services/Integration/LastFmEnrichmentService.cs` - automatically backfills missing tags and album art for untagged tracks on startup.
    - `Services/Integration/AlbumArtService.cs` - unified fallback chain for album art (YouTube > SoundCloud > Last.fm > Placeholder).
    - `Services/Metadata/TrackTitleParser.cs` - cleans messy YouTube titles (strips "Official Video", "ft.", etc.) for accurate Last.fm queries.
- **UI & Navigation**
    - `Helpers/Converters/StringEqualsConverter.cs` & `TrackIdEqualsConverter.cs` - new converters for robust page routing and now-playing indicators.
    - "Now Playing" accent bar added to track rows in `TrackListView` and `PlaylistsView`.
    - OpenWeather API key support added to the encrypted `KeyStore`.

### Changed

- `MainWindow.axaml` - replaced `ContentControl` page routing with direct `IsVisible` bindings to fix `DataContext` inheritance bugs.
- `MainViewModel` - removed `CurrentPageViewModel`; navigation now relies solely on the `CurrentPage` string property.
- `App.axaml` - removed `Application.DataTemplates` section as views are now declared directly in `MainWindow`.
- API keys in Settings now auto-save to the encrypted keystore immediately upon typing (no manual "Save" button required).
- `MetadataService` refactored to use `TrackTitleParser` for cleaner Last.fm fallback searches.

### Fixed

- Library filter tabs (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.) not displaying filtered content due to `ContentControl` `DataContext` reset.
- Search and URL input bar bindings breaking when switching between filtered library views.
- Sidebar filter buttons not visually highlighting when active (Favorites, Recent, Sources).
- "Now playing" row indicator getting lost when switching between filtered library views.

  YouTube thumbnails for existing tracks via `img.youtube.com`
- `LibraryService.BackfillSoundCloudThumbnails()` - on startup, fetches
  missing thumbnails and corrects stale metadata for SoundCloud tracks

### Fixed

- YouTube thumbnails not showing - `_lastFetchedThumbnail` now cached in
  `TrackInputViewModel` and applied when track is added
- SoundCloud thumbnails not showing - fetched via `yt-dlp --print thumbnail`
  and saved to art cache on add and on startup backfill
- `TrackDetailViewModel` field name mismatch (`_track` vs `_currentTrack`)
  caused `IsFavorite` to always return false
- Favorite star always gold in miniplayer and track detail panel -
  `Opacity` now bound to `IsFavorite` via `BoolToOpacityConverter`
- Track detail panel resizing with song title length - fixed `Width="320"`

  `ThumbnailPath` - all call sites updated
- Source badges in `TrackListView` and `TrackDetailView` now colored
  per source instead of generic accent color

- `MetadataService` - `ExtractAlbumArt()`: extracts embedded ID3 art, caches to `~/.nullwave/art/`
- `Helpers/Converters/FilePathToBitmapConverter.cs` - converts file path string to `Bitmap` for Avalonia `Image`
- `TrackDetailViewModel` - `CurrentTrackArtPath` property, refreshed via `RefreshDisplayProperties()`
- `TrackDetailViewModel` - `Save()` now calls `_library.Update()` to persist edits to SQLite
- `PlaybackService` - re-applies volume on `Playing` event to fix silent-start bug on LibVLC pipeline init
- `MainWindow` - keyboard shortcuts: Space (play/pause), </> (seek �5s), M (mute), N (next), P (previous)

### Fixed

- Track list thumbnails not showing - `Image.Source` now uses `FilePathToBitmapConverter` instead of raw string binding
- Track detail panel art not showing - same converter applied to `Detail.CurrentTrackArtPath`
- Miniplayer album art not showing - converter applied to `Player.AlbumArtPath`
- Tracks loaded from DB had no album art - `BackfillAlbumArt()` extracts and saves on startup
- Remove track not working - `RemoveTrackCommand` now accepts `Track` parameter, context menu passes `CommandParameter="{Binding}"`
- Silent start on playback - volume re-applied after LibVLC pipeline initializes
- Shuffle/repeat buttons gave no visual feedback - now use accent color when active

### Changed

- Miniplayer buttons fully redesigned - Spotify-style `.player-btn` class replaces `.icon-btn`
- Miniplayer layout switched from `StackPanel` to two-row `Grid` center section - eliminates vertical clipping
- Miniplayer fixed `Height="90"`, fixed center `Width="440"` - consistent layout at all window sizes
- `LibraryService` constructor now accepts optional `MetadataService` for art extraction
- `MainViewModel` passes `_metadata` to `LibraryService` constructor

## [0.2.0] - 06-Jun-2026

### Added

- `Themes/Shapes.axaml` - `RadiusArt` (6px) corner radius for track art thumbnails
- `Themes/ControlStyles.axaml` - `.danger` button class (red border, fills on hover)
- `Themes/ControlStyles.axaml` - `ListBoxItem` opacity transition (150ms fade-in on add)
- `MiniPlayerView` - shuffle toggle (`IsShuffle`, `ShuffleIcon`, `ToggleShuffleCommand`)
- `MiniPlayerView` - repeat mode cycle: None > All > One (`CycleRepeatCommand`, `RepeatIcon`)
- `MiniPlayerView` - seek slider now fires only on `PointerReleased` (no feedback loop)
- `MiniPlayerView` - `-5s` / `+5s` seek buttons replacing broken Unicode glyphs
- `MiniPlayerView` - volume slider restored (`Mode=TwoWay` on `Player.Volume`)
- `PlayerViewModel` - `RepeatMode` enum (None/One/All), shuffle with random non-repeat pick
- `PlayerViewModel` - `OnTrackFinished()` wired: autoplay next, repeat-one replay, repeat-all wrap
- `PlayerViewModel` - `SeekTo(float)` public method called from code-behind on seek release
- `PlayerViewModel` - `PlaySelectedTrackRequested` event - play button starts selected track when nothing loaded
- `TrackDetailViewModel` - subscribes to `Track.PropertyChanged` so `PlayCount` and `LastPlayed` update live
- `TrackListView` - unified toolbar: search + sort `ComboBox` + `SplitButton` (`+ Add` with dropdown)
- `TrackListView` - collapsible URL input row toggled by `Input.ShowUrlInputCommand`
- `TrackListView` - URL input row has `Opacity` transition (200ms fade)
- `TrackDetailView` - `Opacity` + `Margin` transitions on slide-in panel
- `TrackInputViewModel` - `IsUrlInputVisible` + `ShowUrlInputCommand` for toggling URL row

- `TrackInputViewModel` - `AddFolderPathAsync()` recursively imports audio files from a folder
- `TrackInputViewModel` - `StatusMessage` property for live import feedback

- `DownloadService` - `IsPlaylistUrl()` static helper (detects `list=`, `/sets/`, `/playlist/`)
- `DownloadService` - `DownloadPlaylistAsync()` - fetches flat metadata via `--flat-playlist --dump-json`, then downloads each track individually with per-track progress callbacks
- `SidebarView` - 32?32 logo placeholder ("N" in accent square) beside NullWave wordmark
- `MainViewModel` - wires `Player.PlaySelectedTrackRequested` > play selected or first track
- SQLite-net-pcl + SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green packages added (persistence implementation coming next)

### Fixed

- Seek slider feedback loop - `Mode=TwoWay` > `Mode=OneWay`, seek fires on pointer release only
- Volume slider broken after previous refactor - binding and converter references cleaned up
- Play button on miniplayer did nothing when no track was loaded - now starts selected track
- `PlayCount` and `LastPlayed` in detail panel never updated after playback - fixed via INPC subscription
- `AddTrack()` fired with empty inputs showing no feedback - now toggles URL input row instead
- `AddFolderPathAsync` spurious `async` warning (CS1998) removed
- `ImportPlaylistAsync` fire-and-forget warning (CS4014) suppressed with explicit discard

### Changed

- `+ Add Track` + `Import �` two-button toolbar replaced with single `SplitButton`
